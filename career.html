	<h1>My Career Plans</h1>
	<a href="index.html">index</a>
	<p>I have plans to obtain my degree in Graphic Design. However, I have other plans for my life. Who says you only have to have one career? I also have a photography business, a license for giving tattoos, and I'm working on my 100 dives to become a certified PADI divemaster.

	<h2> Iron Chairs</h2>
	<p>This is a beautiful set of chairs in front of a very peacful background. This was one of the first pictures I had ever taken. So you could say my love for photography started with those old iron chairs. I also had many inspirations for example being Larry Beard, a landscape photographer. You can look at some of his work in the link below.
